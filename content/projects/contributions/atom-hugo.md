The [Atom plugin](https://atom.io/packages/atom-hugo) that allows users to launch a Hugo server with live refresh.

- On every hugo server lanuch, three or four pages would open instead of the one.
- The hugo server would not shutdown on macOS when wanting to exit.

I took this oportunity to fix the issue, as well as learn CoffeeScript to do it.
